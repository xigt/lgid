line=100 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,650.0,524.61,662.0 iscore=0.07: implies accessibility to the speaker alone. (For obvious reasons, there are no linguistic devices

line=104 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,590.0,512.63,602.0 iscore=0.29: but the use of such flags doesn’t entail non-specificity. For example, German ‘irgendein N’

line=111 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,455.0,529.57,467.0 iscore=0.11: these are not the only cases. Consider (1a), for example. It would be patently wrong to say that

line=116 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,380.0,518.65,392.0 iscore=0.13: in the absence of telltale scope-bearing expressions. The answer to this question, I submit, is
line=117 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,365.0,505.62,377.0 iscore=0.20: that by and large we can’t. That is to say, the chief problem for a theory of specificity is to

line=280 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,310.0,529.69,322.0 iscore=0.12: different theories of specificity. On the one hand, theories that seek to deal with specificity with

line=283 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,265.0,525.67,277.0 iscore=0.12: quantifier raising will find it quite difficult to explain the distributive readings — a point which
line=284 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,250.0,525.62,262.0 iscore=0.19: Winter (1997) emphasizes, because  he is confident, apparently, that such readings don’t occur

line=298 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,596.0,467.61,608.0 iscore=0.06: consists of three principal claims. The first of these is that anaphora is a species of
line=299 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,581.0,511.63,593.0 iscore=0.06: presupposition, and that the standard presupposition-inducing expressions (such as definite
line=300 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,566.0,529.6,578.0 iscore=0.20 : NPs, factives, transition verbs, and so on) differ from pronominal anaphors mainly in that they
line=301 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,551.0,502.62,563.0 iscore=0.13: possess a richer semantic content. This difference explains why in general presupposition
line=302 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,536.0,518.62,548.0 iscore=0.38: inducers, unlike anaphoric pronouns, can be interpreted by way of accommodation, which is
line=303 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,521.0,515.71,533.0 iscore=0.19: the second key notion in the theory. Finally, it is assumed that the process of presupposition
line=304 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,506.0,495.63,518.0 iscore=0.25: projection is subject to certain constraints. It is the status of these constraints that will be
line=305 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,491.0,256.64,503.0 iscore=0.25: especially important in the following.
line=306 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=94.5,476.0,514.66,488.0 iscore=0.00:   Formulated  in procedural terms, the binding theory predicts that if an utterance contains a
line=307 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,461.0,529.74,473.0 iscore=0.07: presupposition-inducing element, the hearer will initially attempt to bind the presupposition to a
line=308 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,446.0,507.58,458.0 iscore=0.20: suitable antecedent, just as he would try to bind an ordinary anaphor. If the presupposition
line=309 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,431.0,490.67,443.0 iscore=0.19: cannot be so bound, it will be accommodated, i.e. it will be inserted in some accessible
line=310 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,416.0,492.71,428.0 iscore=0.25: discourse representation structure (DRS). In general the number of positions at which a
line=311 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,401.0,525.64,413.0 iscore=0.29: presupposition may be accommodated  is greater than one, and if it is the choice is restricted by
line=312 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,386.0,523.59,398.0 iscore=0.35: various constraints, but before I turn to these, let me first illustrate the workings of the theory:

line=314 fonts=F0-12.0,F1-12.0 bbox=80.5,326.0,521.5,338.0             : This sentence contains (at least) two presupposition-inducing expressions: the definite NP his
line=315 fonts=F0-12.0,F1-12.0 bbox=80.5,311.0,515.83,323.0 iscore=0.12: son, which triggers the presupposition that Fred has a son, and the focus particle too, which
line=316 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,296.0,495.59,308.0 iscore=0.25        : triggers the presupposition that someone other than Fred’s son is gay. Note that the first
line=317 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,281.0,524.64,293.0 iscore=0.25        : presupposition is ‘inherited’ by the sentence as a whole, while the second one is not: normally
line=318 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,266.0,522.64,278.0 iscore=0.25        : speaking, an utterance of (23) would license the inference that (according to the speaker) Fred
line=319 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,251.0,531.59,263.0 iscore=0.39        : has a son, but not that someone else besides Fred’s son is gay. The binding theory accounts for
line=320 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,236.0,531.63,248.0 iscore=0.17        : these observations as follows. Suppose that the grammar assigns (23) the intermediate semantic

line=322 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,206.0,510.62,218.0 iscore=0.32        : cleared out of the way already, and that the only thing that remains to be done is resolve the
line=323 fonts=F0-12.0,F1-12.0 bbox=80.5,191.0,502.61,203.0 iscore=0.11: presuppositions triggered by his son and too, which are marked out by single and double

line=332 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,635.0,518.6,647.0             : (24a) is the initial semantic representation correlated with (23), in which two presuppositions
line=333 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,620.0,523.57,632.0 iscore=0.22: remain to be resolved. One of these, that Fred has a son, cannot be bound, and therefore must
line=334 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,605.0,522.68,617.0 iscore=0.22: be interpreted by way of accommodation. Now there is a general constraint on presupposition
line=335 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,590.0,517.68,602.0 iscore=0.24: projection to the effect that any presupposition prefers to be projected to as high a position as
line=336 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,575.0,502.59,587.0 iscore=0.12: possible, and accordingly our first presupposition is accommodated in the principal DRS,
line=337 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,560.0,501.62,572.0 iscore=0.31: which yields (24b). The remaining presupposition, triggered by the focus particle, can be
line=338 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,545.0,522.66,557.0 iscore=0.19: bound in the antecedent of the conditional; this results in (24c) which, assuming that Fred and
line=339 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,530.0,325.53,542.0 iscore=0.12: his son are different persons, is equivalent to (24d).
line=340 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=94.5,515.0,435.68,527.0 iscore=0.17:   The  binding theory may be summed  up in the following three principles:

doc_id=89 page=11 block_id=11-3 bbox=80.5,455.0,427.55,497.0 label=tbbt 341 343
line=341 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,485.0,427.55,497.0            : (A)   Presuppositions must be projected (i.e., bound or accommodated).
line=342 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,470.0,299.62,482.0 iscore=0.22: (B)   Binding is preferred to accommodation.
line=343 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,455.0,416.6,467.0 iscore=0.27 : (C)   A presupposition must be projected to the highest possible DRS.

doc_id=89 page=11 block_id=11-4 bbox=80.5,125.0,532.7,437.0 label=tbbb 344 364
line=344 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,425.0,519.62,437.0            : It will be evident that none of these principles is absolute, although the first two may be more
line=345 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,410.0,515.69,422.0 iscore=0.39: absolute than the last one. They are all subject to general constraints on interpretation, which
line=346 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,395.0,519.66,407.0 iscore=0.27: require that an interpretation be consistent, coherent, and so on. Before these principles come
line=347 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,380.0,521.66,392.0 iscore=0.07: into play, presuppositions are merely representational structures, and are therefore completely
line=348 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,365.0,515.67,377.0 iscore=0.20: inert. Principle A drives away the inertia by insisting that presuppositions be either bound or
line=349 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,350.0,505.7,362.0 iscore=0.07 : accommodated.  Principle B captures the insight that accommodation is a repair strategy: in
line=350 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,335.0,462.57,347.0 iscore=0.25: principle, a presupposition wants to be bound, but if it cannot be bound it will be
line=351 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,320.0,527.66,332.0 iscore=0.25: accommodated.  Principle C may be viewed as a generalization of a constraint first proposed by
line=352 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,305.0,517.67,317.0 iscore=0.13: Heim (1983). Heim  distinguishes between two types of accommodation: global and local. In
line=353 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,290.0,511.65,302.0 iscore=0.20: terms of the present framework, a presupposition is accommodated globally if it goes to the
line=354 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,275.0,513.62,287.0 iscore=0.31: principal DRS, and locally if it is accommodated in the DRS where it was triggered. Heim’s
line=355 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,260.0,513.67,272.0 iscore=0.19: proposal is that, in general, global accommodation is preferred to local accommodation, and
line=356 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,245.0,532.7,257.0 iscore=0.27 : principle C generalizes this in two ways. First, this principle applies not only to accommodation
line=357 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,230.0,517.66,242.0 iscore=0.27: but to projection in general. This makes some difference from an observational point of view

line=420 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,365.0,519.65,377.0 iscore=0.07: parallels as well as the differences between definites and specific indefinites. The reason why
line=421 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,350.0,530.68,362.0 iscore=0.19: definites and specific indefinites are so similar is that they are interpreted by the same projection

line=423 fonts=F0-12.0 bbox=80.5,320.0,468.63,332.0 iscore=0.20: bound. Thirdly, the theory accounts in a principled way for the puzzling pattern of
